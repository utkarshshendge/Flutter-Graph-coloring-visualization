### TO-DO
- [ ] Add responsivenes   
- [ ] Add bloc pattern  
- [ ] Clean code   

# How to use?
Here are few things you need to know:
1. [What is graph coloring Algorithm?](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/graph-coloring-applications/)
1. [What is adjacency matrix?](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/graph-and-its-representations/)

## 1 Enter the number of vertices you wish to have in your graph.

## 2 A grid view will appear with dimensions x x where x is number of vertices you entered .

  Adjacency matrix for graph with 9 vertices will look something like this:

## 3 Fill the matrix by tapping on it(indexing starts from 0).

## 4 You got it right!!.Adjust the nodes(vertices) and see coloring.
