## Motivation
Few days back I was studying Design and Analysis of Algorithms and came accross graph coloring Algorithm.
The greedy approach was easy to understand and picture but, I came up with a different complex graph and It made naive recursive approach difficult to picture in my mind.
I searched for Visualizations they were hard coded for a specific graph, however I wanted to try it on my own graph.
So I made something of my own that gives flexiblity and demonstrates recurvie approach :D

## How to use?
Here are few things you need to know:
1. [What is graph coloring Algorithm?](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/graph-coloring-applications/)
1. [What is adjacency matrix?](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/graph-and-its-representations/)

### 1 Enter the number of vertices you wish to have in your graph.

### 2 A grid view will appear with dimensions x x where x is number of vertices you entered .

  Adjacency matrix for graph with 9 vertices will look something like this:

### 3 Fill the matrix by tapping on it(indexing starts from 0).

### 4 You got it right!!.Adjust the nodes(vertices) and see coloring.

## To-do
* Add provider and seperate algorithms from UI pages
* Add more trees/graphs related algorithms.
